============

Interactive Hallway Attraction and Retention Technology
This is an Interactive Hallway Attraction that allows you to interact with different scenes like the spots and
horoscope randomly popping up when their is facial recognition. The IHart database was created by Audrey St.John but we recreated
and adjusted it to focus on this scene where you can see someone's face and then spots would randomly appear. It will also do the 
same with different horoscopes given.
